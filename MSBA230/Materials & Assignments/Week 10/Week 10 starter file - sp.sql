/*
OUTPUT parameter
Create a sp that given a VendorID returns the number of orders and the total 
invoice.

Create a new table called InvoiceReport with the following columns:
VendorID, NumberOfOrders, TotalInvoice, DateOfInquery

I want to store the result of the sp in this table. How can I do that?

1- Create a stored procedure that when passed a course number returns the number of
students enrolled. If the course number doesn’t exist display a message. Write the
code to execute the stored procedure for course number: 82754
2- Create a stored procedure that returns the list of departments and the name of the
chairs. Execute the stored procedure.
3- Create a stored procedure that when passed an optional year returns all the
instructors that have been hired since then. The result should have 4 columns: ID,
Name, Department name, Years hired. If no new instructors have been hired display
a message rather than an empty table. Execute the stored procedure once with no
parameter and once for 2018.
4- Create a stored procedure that will be used to add a new record to the students
